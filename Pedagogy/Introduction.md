# The pedagogy of physics demonstrations

Demos are almost always entertaining, but are these educating as well? In an article in the *American Journal of Physics*:

> Despite popular beliefs to the contrary, students learn little, if anything, from traditionally presented classroom demonstrations. {cite:t}`crouch2004classroom`

Without any strategy to the didactical approach, demonstrations are not likely to increase students' comprehension of the phenomenon at hand. Hence, this book not only presents many physics demonstrations, it also delves in the strategies that can be applied when conducting a physics demonstration. Before elaborating on specific strategies, we cover some basic ideas. 

## What can you accomplish with demonstrations?
So what exactly can you accomplish with demonstrations? The overall learning goals can be categorized as follows (after Hodson, 1993):
- "Students learn to better understand theory by relating it to the world around them," we often hear. "The students learn to better understand the world around them by linking it to theory" we also consider very important. This is "learning physics". Our *Demonstrations for conceptual development* covers this learning objective. 
Most of the demonstrations in this book relate to conceptual development. These demonstrations have been chosen for their suitability to elucidate a physical phenomen or concept. They belong in the regular instruction lessons. The descriptions often include step-by-step suggestions for didactic implementation, including opportunities to get students thinking for themselves as much as possible. They stimulate physical thinking and help students build a physical concept network.

- You teach students to investigate the world around them for themselves. They learn to ask scientific questions, and to answer them based on observations, with whatever it takes to get that done. During this process, the students get an idea what it is to be a scientist and how science work. They learn to "do physics". Our *Demonstrations on teaching scientific inquiry and/or nature of science* cover this learning objective
What does *"It is scientifically proven"* mean? What makes it so valuable? What do you have to do to prove something scientifically, and how sure are you then of your case? The demonstrations described here revolve around the skills that are indispensable in scientific research on the one hand and about the characteristics of doing science on the other. These skills include carefully observing, critically analyzing a problem, developing a model to explain observations, or testing expectations with an experiment (Pols, Dekkers & de Vries, 2022). The knowledge created in the process is man-made. That knowledge is as certain as knowledge ever gets and yet will always be open to improvement. 

- Demonstrations motivate students, evoke pleasure in physics, arouse interest in the subject, develop fascination with the phenomena. They contribute to an understanding of the motivations of physicists and an appreciation of their achievements. This is called "learning about physics". *Demonstrations for good fun*, well, needs no further explanation.
Demonstrations also play a role at special occasions: at an open day, at an anniversary, at a farewell. In this book you  will find examples of demonstrations that stimulate thought, but which also have a surprising or playful twist, making them suitable to show at such special occasions. The topics are by no means always part of the school physics curriculum. However. they all appeal to common sense and the outcome is often counterintuitive. The charm of physics is shown to its full advantage in this volume!




ShowingPhysics illustrates the many possibilities of demonstrations in the physics classroom. The emphasis in each case is on involving students in the demonstration. After all, only then can learning effects occur. In part 1, we mostly used P(E)OE
as a didactic approach, in part 2 the concept cartoon was additionally brought up.
This third book again uses these didactic insertions, but now we want to
include natural science skills, reasoning with evidence from
elaborate and provide examples of experiments and practices in research and design.
In Natural Science Skills-Part A of this book-the teacher is given suggestions on how to
get students thinking about the nature of the natural sciences and, more specifically,
physics. What does it mean that something has been experimentally demonstrated?
What is the most convincing answer to a research question?
Thus, not only understanding development is central but also the underlying
knowledge of what natural science is, can and cannot do.

In demonstrations, the demonstrator knows what is going to happen and (s)he knows the associated questions and answers. So a demonstration is not a real investigation, but it can show students what doing research means. What it means to try to find the
most convincing answer to a physics question. These are the typical questions we can raise with students:
1. What is happening here? Do I understand this, or is it different than I thought?
2. What does it mean what is happening here? When we say that physically it is really like this, what exactly do we mean?
3. Is this really true? Can I convince myself and others that it really is?

In research, all of these questions are important. In demonstrations, not all of them and
certainly not all of them at the same time. Demonstrations play a role in a learning
process and so there you have to offer questions in steps and gradually shift the
emphasis over the course of the learning process to more complex questions. That gives
the viewer an opportunity for processing and of developing skills that ultimately add up to
an inquisitive attitude.

Questions like the first question encourage *back-and-forth thinking between theory and
practice*. This includes demonstrations in which something happens that you don't
expect and that raises questions. With this you can illustrate how in physical research
you are constantly testing theory and practice against each other. Students experience
this with the support of the teacher in the demonstrations. See the chapter: "Back and
forth thinking in demonstrations".

Questions like question two focus on *argumentation*. Students seem satisfied with
any answer, whereas only the most *convincing* answer possible is good enough.
But what do we find convincing, and why? Demonstrations can develop scientific
understanding of this in students. See the chapter "Argumentation and Persuasion".

Questions such as question three deal with the *nature of science (Nature of Science)*. In successful research the researcher is looking for something that was not already known.
But what exactly does it mean when that researcher says, "I have scientifically
established this. Is it then definitely and definitely true? Does another researcher then
always and everywhere come to the same conclusion? Demonstrations contribute to an
understanding of the nature and quality of the product of physical research: scientific
knowledge. See the *Nature of Science (NoS)* chapter.

> Argumentation and persuasion are obviously part of the general education and
citizenship skills of all students. Back-and-forth thinking is of great importance in
achieving theory building. Understanding the Nature of Science contributes to the
scientific literacy of all students.

## Development of inquiry skills through demonstrations
Conducting scientific research is a matter of making targeted and careful observations, using your knowledge to understand them, and vice versa, adjusting your knowledge and determining with which subsequent observations you can test and substantiate claims. Demonstrations are an excellent opportunity to practice this with students. Many important questions can be asked and addressed:
* What can I conclude from the observations? 
* How confident am I in this, can the conclusion be strengthened? 
* If I change something, what will happen? 
* And if it does or does not, what will I learn from it? 

This back-and-forth thinking between practice and theory characterizes research (Van den Berg, 2012). *In demonstrations, you can stimulate that thinking, guide it, and help improve it in a
pleasant, motivating and safe way.* As always, the trick here is to maintain the balance between challenging students, provide autonomy to think and do for themselves on the one hand, and supporting, scaffolding, encouraging and directing them on the other. What students know and can do themselves already should be done by them. But as a teacher you can take over, or help them, when students find it still too difficult. In between, choose the learning objectives for your demonstration. There should not be too many, and they should be achievable by the students with some effort. This will only succeed if you offer your students a route using targeted questions and assignments, but one in which they can also have their input and make their own contributions.

Learn physics means doing physics. But can students participate in a demonstration? After all, scientific problems are not really solved and students do not manipulate the materials... Your students may assume that with a little effort they can eventually understand the surprising phenomena - a guarantee you don't get in normal physics research. You already know in advance "what must come out," you as a teacher need only reproduce (well, only) the observations, and you can suffice with giving the corresponding explanation. You can do it that way, but it doesn't have to stop there. Your demonstration can also contribute to the development of inquiry skills, and that is fairly easy to incorporate.

To that end, as a teacher, reduce the research problems and confront students with them. Reenact the solving of those problems, as it were, during your demonstration, because there is a lot to learn from that. The easiest way to do this is to ask your students questions like:

* What do you think will happen?
* What do you know about the set up?
* What exactly did you see? What did you notice?
* How would you describe your observations as accurately as possible?
* Did happen what you expected to happen?
* If we would repeat the demonstration, what would we pay special attention to?
* How can we improve our observations?
* Can you explain what happened and why it happened?
* Did we learn something from it? How does that fit with what we already know? What do we not yet know and how can we find out?

By finding the answers together, valuing them, testing them where possible, students practice the skills they need when they "learn physics" and "do physics" on their own. The demonstrations in Part XXXX of this book focus explicitly on that, but you can work on those skills in this way in all the other demonstrations as well. Of course, you adapt them to your own needs, supplementing them with your own ideas. Furthermore, you don't ask all these questions in one demo, of course; that would be far too difficult (for students as well as for the teacher). A clear, defined goal is given some extra attention based on a few appropriate questions. Examples follow below.

You can distinguish three levels of difficulty, depending on what you want to achieve didactically. In the simplest demonstration, you show a surprising phenomenon and your students practice scientifically "observing" and "interpreting". It gets a little trickier when you not only make the connection between the observations and the interpretation but also substantiate it by describing, explaining and predicting the observations. The third type of demo involves skills associated with the limits of the knowledge found. *What assumptions have been made? In what situation is the conclusion no longer valid? Once your students have identified the limits to the found knowledge based on such questions, you can ask them if it is still valid beyond those limits. Can the conclusion be generalized? Does the conclusion raise new questions, and how can they be answered?* In the step that then follows, you need all the skills at once and, as a teacher, you can often run out of answers. After all, in this most beautiful but most difficult type, it becomes real physics research.
