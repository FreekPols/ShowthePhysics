# Nature of Science 
As a physics teacher, you are not only responsible for imparting knowledge to your students, but also for conveying an idea of what natural sciences are and what scientists are trying to achieve. In an era  when the (social) media sometimes spread nonsense about science, it is important that as a teacher you counterbalance it. Indeed, wrong ideas about science carry risks, as we saw during the recent corona crisis in which science was sometimes dismissed as "just another opinion" and scientists were even threatened. A good understanding of Ohm's law is important for a passing grade on a test, but a correct understanding of what science means and its purpose is just as important.

But what image of the natural sciences should you convey as a physics teacher? What characterizes science? How is science different from art or religion, for example? And what do you do with it in your physics lesson? Such questions are discussed in the professional literature under the label "*Nature of Science*" (NoS).

## Why focus on NoS in physics class?
The question of what natural science -philosophically speaking- is can perhaps never be answered satisfactorily for everyone. But for school purposes there is no need to do so at all. It is enough if we can teach students important features of natural science on which there is agreement. When that is done successfully, your students understand what natural science is, what to expect from it and what not. This enables students to participate as empowered citizens in social discussions about issues with a scientific background and to make decisions in their personal lives, such as about vaccinations or environmental issues.

For the vast majority of students, this "*scientific literacy*" is more important for their future lives than substantive physics knowledge. In addition, attention to NoS can make education more interesting, engaging and motivating for many students. It is worthwhile for that reason alone.

Teaching with attention to NoS may be easier than you think. It often requires you to avoid doing things that you are normally accustomed to doing. For example, one of the things you should put off for as long as possible is giving the "right answer". At school it often seems to be about knowing the right answer, and "wrong answers" are rejected. After all, scientists are constantly searching for possible explanations and convincing others of their methods and answers. To make this clear to students, it is sometimes better to delay giving the "right answer" for as long as possible and focus on the process of searching for the most acceptable answer. In this way, students can experience the essence of science and develop a critical view of scientific issues, which will later enable them to participate as empowered citizens in societal discussions.

## Thoughts and insights
The interest in NoS education stems from the observation that customary education often produces conceptions of science that are out of touch with reality and can even have disastrous effects on how students view and value science ({cite:t}`mccomas2020principal`). {numref}`Table {number} <tab:undesirable_conclusions>` provides some examples of messages that can be evoked by customary education and the conceptions of science that this can produce.

```{list-table} Common undesirable conclusions and beliefs about natural sciences.
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab:undesirable_conclusions

* - Messages that physics classes can unintentionally convey 
  - Unwanted conclusions students may draw from it
* - Scientists are not creative: they just follow set rules and methods.
  - Physics and other natural sciences are boring.
* - Carefully collected evidence leads to unambiguous and certain knowledge
  - Scientists cannot interpret data.
* - Scientific models represent reality in the best possible way.
  - If several models exist, only one can be the right one.
* -  Science is universal and scientists are absolutely objective. Therefore, good scientists always agree.
  - If scientists disagree, we cannot trust them.
```

While it may be clear, that the above views of science are not desirable, it is not easy to find the right balance in your lesson. You may, of course, show that scientists work in a systematic and structured way and that this has enormous advantages. Students also need to know that there are reliable models for carefully describing, explaining and predicting processes and events. There is no need to hide scientists' commitment to consensus and objectivity. But it is literally and figuratively a waste if we do not also show students that science is, in principle, always open to criticism and improvement. This is not a weakness, but a strength! It is precisely this that makes the growth and development of scientific knowledge possible, and distinguishes the natural sciences from dogmatic and rigid explanatory models.

{numref}`Table {number} <tab:char_of_nos>` shows examples of some of the characteristics of NoS about which much has been written in the subject teaching literature. It includes examples of desired and undesired views for each characteristic. The desirable views reflect the current state of the scientific literature on NoS. The table is not exhaustive, nor is it intended to be given to students, but it is very suitable for reflecting on your own view of NoS.

```{list-table} Characteristics of NoS and undesirable and desirable attitudes.
:header-rows: 1
:name: tab:char_of_nos

* - Nature of Science aspect
  - Example of common view
  - Example of desired view
* - The role of observations, experiments and consistency with scientific theories
  - The only way to gain knowledge is to do experiments. Observations and experiments can prove scientific theories.
  - Scientists use various methods (including experiments) and mutual exchange to develop scientific knowledge. Observations can support or refute scientific theories, but not prove them.
* - Scientific theory
  - Theories are vague conjectures. (In the colloquial language you often use the word theory this way).
  - A scientific theory-for example, the theory of relativity is a coherent structure of validated and generalized accepted explanations of phenomena. (Make students aware of the difference between everyday language and professional language.)
* - The role of scientific models
  - Scientific models are representations of reality.
  - Models are designed to explain or predict certain aspects of phenomena. Therefore, different scientific models relating to the same phenomenon exist.
* - Provisionality of scientific knowledge
  - Scientific knowledge is certain and immutable.
  - Scientific knowledge is enduring and reliable but is fundamentally always open to development, change and improvement.
* - Creativity in science
  - There is only one step-by-step way for scientific inquiry (the natural science method).
  - There is no such thing as "the scientific method". On the contrary, scientists try to increase scientific knowledge in different ways. This often requires creativity.
* - Subjectivity in science
  - Scientists are objective and therefore only one correct interpretation of observations is possible.
  - Although scientific research strives for independent knowledge, it remains human work. This means that science is influenced by historical, cultural, social and economic conditions and by personal preferences of researchers. There is a difference between observation and interpretation.
* - Controversies in science
  - Fellow researchers immediately recognize and
accept new scientific knowledge.
  - Discussions and disagreements about scientific ideas are essential to scientific development. Different interpretations can coexist.
* - Scientists
  - Only in Western culture does one practice
physics. It is only for boys.
  - People (women and men) from all cultures contribute to science. (Two reasons why we know mostly white men as scientists: Other groups of people were denied access to education, and textbooks usually say little about the influence of scientists from other cultures.)

## How can you bring attention to NoS into your lesson?

An excellent start are *Black-Box* activities, especially if they evoke immediate surprise and confusion. You perform small experiments with an object (the *Black- box*). The result is the *output* of the *Black-Box*. But the mechanism by which it arrives at that output remains hidden. Students often feel that
they can understand "how it is" and they immediately go to investigate. In a demonstration, you have excellent opportunities to then direct that and explore together. See for example the NoS activities 'Cylinder puzzle'(A06) and "Magic or not?"(A05) in this book or check out this English-language website of the Royal Society of Chemistry: edu.rsc.org/resources/black-box/1275.article

Students may feel like "scientists" when conducting their own research, but they do not learn directly from it what science is; and they do not naturally gain an understanding of NoS. The same is not true of student practicals, and even when students participate in real research projects - for example, during internships - they do not automatically and spontaneously understand the nature of the natural sciences. Developing an understanding of NoS requires that you work with students to look back at what they have thought and done why, and compare that to how scientists think and work. For example, go over with students why one explanation is found to be less good than another. In retrospect, discuss how they made decisions during their investigations. So reflect with students on what they themselves experienced and draw explicit conclusions from that about what science is and how scientists work. Students' own experiences from research then help them give content and meaning to NoS. If you teach NoS "dry," it is soon forgotten.

## Demonstrations as a NoS activity
You can also make all other demonstrations and experiments into NoS activities. There are fixed elements that fit into almost all demonstrations. For example, you can ask the following questions:
1. *Did you see it yourself and really observe it, or did you make it up?*  
Young students especially tend not to distinguish between observation and interpretation: what you see, what you think it is and what it is. In the "Magic" demonstration, you pour a transparent liquid into a funnel and then collect about the same amount of transparent liquid in a beaker. Is that the same liquid? Is it water? The demonstration shows that you can't just assume that. The distinction may matter.

2. *What did you observe? Did others notice? Was there anything else you noticed?*  
Perceiving does not happen automatically. It is influenced by your knowledge and expectations. When you know what to look for you see more, and that includes science. Fleming's discovery of the effect of penicillin based on some forgotten bacterial cultures is certainly no exception. If you don't tell students what you want them to see but leave that up to them, the variety of observations turns out to be enormous. This is not always the intention, but can help if you want to demonstrate the importance of focused observation in research.

3. *How did that come about? Can you explain how that happened? Are there any other possible explanations?*  
In the "Cylinder Puzzle," use students' own statements to discuss NoS. It is important to keep the demonstration simple enough to allow some comparison of the quality of the explanations.

4. *What can we do to see if your explanation could be correct? How can we test your hypothesis?*  
An explanation gains value only when it fits the observations, and it is stronger the better it fits and excludes more alternatives. Coming up with your own tests for explanations is important and instructive.  Another reason not to be too quick to bring in the "right answer.

5. *Have we now proved with this research that our conclusion is true? (For example, have we proved Hooke's law?)*  
The concept of scientific proof is tricky. You cannot prove Hooke's law in the same way as the Pythagorean theorem: with the latter, you don't need observations. Moreover, from a finite number of observations you can never logically draw an inference about all the observations yet to come: this is called the 'induction problem'. Nevertheless, the validity and reliability of the observations in a study contribute to the quality of the conclusion.

As a teacher, the trick is to properly assess when and with which students you will go deeper into a particular feature of NoS. If you are open to it, very useful conversations can arise from it. For example, discuss that an "experiment" is by definition an investigation in which variables are controlled (i.e., held constant). Discussion will then surely include research in astronomy or paleontology. Some think that scientific knowledge can only be gained from experimental research, but there are all kinds of acceptable scientific research, experiments are only one form. For more engaging and often philosophical questions about NoS that you can use directly in the classroom, check out the Flemish website www.wetenschapsreflex.be.

And if you want to talk to your students about stereotypes (Why do so many people think science is mainly for white men?), Margriet van der Heijden's book "Ongekend" gives fascinating insights into how women were often systematically opposed and how their important contributions to science were forgotten.
