# Magic with pendulums 


Author:     Maarten van Woerkom\
Time:	  	  20 minutes\
Age group:	12 and up\
Concepts:	  period, resonance

## Introduction
5 or 6 pendulums are suspended from a rod (figure 1). Turn the rod slightly back-and-forth and some pendulums will start moving. By tuning the frequency of the turning, the teacher can choose which pendulum will move.

The demo is easy to set up

## Equipment
Use as rod a 70 cm piece of broomstick. The strings should have a thickness of several mm. Use wooden balls with a diameter of approximately 7 cm (available from toy or hobby websites). Give each ball a different color. Drill a narrow hole through each ball and through the broom stick. The string can be secured on either side with a knot. 

## Preparation
Practice several times with the rod and balls until your fingers know the resonant frequencies of each ball.

## Procedure
Hold the rod on the two ends (figure 2) in such a way that the balls will be in front of your face and body so the attention of the students will not be on the hands but on the colored balls. Now play a game about which ball will start moving. For example, ask students to concentrate on the red ball. Then make the red ball move with almost invisible turns of the rod at resonant frequency of the red ball. Same for other colors, ask the audience which ball should move and tell them that you can do this through your will power. But of course you make clever use of the different resonance frequencies. 

```{tip}
*	For a large audience it is better to use a large set-up with long pendulums then the resonant frequency is not too high.
*	Refer to other examples of resonance such as the Tacoma Narrows Bridge which collapsed in 1940.
```
## Physics background
Each pendulum has its unique resonance frequency dependent on its length. Even turning the rod a few mm is sufficient to achieve a large amplitude of the ball if the resonance frequency is used. By practicing you can find out quickly about the proper frequencies.
