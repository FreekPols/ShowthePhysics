# Cappuccino and specific heat versus heat of vaporization


Author:     Frits Hidden, Jorn Boomsma, Anton Schins, Ed van den Berg\
Time:	  	10 - 15 minutes, more if student computation work is integrated in the demo.\
Age group:	14 - 18\
Concepts:	Heat of vaporization ($L_v$) and condensation, specific heat, applying $Q = c \cdot m \cdot Î”T$ and $Q = m \cdot L \cdot v$
