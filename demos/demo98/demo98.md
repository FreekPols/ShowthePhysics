# Implosion

Author:     \
Time:	15 minutes  	\
Age group:	From grade 8 onwards \
Concepts:	pressure, vapour pressure, forces

## Introduction
You demonstrate the force exerted by the outside air on a vessel in which water has just evaporated. A classic and spectacular demonstration! 
A demonstration because the vessel is hot when it is closed, because the forces are enormous and because you simply don't have this kind of large vessel in student-fold.

Heating a can with a layer of water.
```

## Equipment
* Sealable metal container (slightly cleaned oil drum, a large paint can, an empty soft drink can); 
gas burner large enough to heat the container; 
* room temperature water; 
* wet rag; 
* cold water (possibly with ice cubes) and gloves.

## Preparation
Test the demonstration so that you know approximately how long it takes for the can to implode. 

## Procedure
Put a small layer of water in the can and heat it. What happens to the air in the can? Let the water boil for some time, so that the water vapour can displace the air present. Close the - now hot - container with the cap tightly. Don't burn your hands! Turn off the gas. What is now in the sealed vessel? What happens when the contents cool down? 
Now bring a wet cloth over the vessel. Wet the cloth liberally with cold (ice) water.

## Physics background
The vessel is filled with air and a layer of liquid water. Heating the water creates water vapour. If the stopper is open, the vessel is filled with water vapour and air at normal pressure. You close the vessel and cool it down. Now the water vapour condenses. Now, at lower temperatures, air can contain much less water vapour per litre of air. The pressure in the sealed vessel is now much lower than the pressure of the outside air and the vessel will be compressed from the outside. 
With a robust vessel like an oil drum, it can take several minutes for something to happen!

```{tip} 
The living room version of this experiment uses a soda can. Now you need a container of cold water and a beaker pliers. When the water in the can is well boiled through, pick it up with the tongs and put it in the cold water with the opening facing down as quickly as possible. The stopper is not needed now. The can crumples.
The teacher can give a bonus to students who can show a video of their own imploding soda can.

## Follow-up
There are several videos on [YouTube](www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5_ho2sc0fc) about this phenomenon.
