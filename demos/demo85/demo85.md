## Introduction

This surprising demonstration makes the PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) behavior of light bulbs visible. Explaining the observations requires a lot of back-and-forth thinking. You can provide it at various levels. The demonstration is suitable for checking understanding at the end of a chapter or section on resistance, current, and voltage in series circuits.

During the demonstration, you continuously move the connection of the negative terminal from left to right, so that the first time only one bulb is switched on and the last time all bulbs are connected.

During the demonstration, you gradually move the connection of the negative pole from left to right, so that the first time only one light bulb is switched on and the last time all light bulbs are connected.

The situation just after moving the connection. The third light bulb burns barely visible and takes some time to become as bright as the other two.


## Equipment

Power source and four or five identical light bulbs including connection materials.

## Preparation
Set up and already connect the links between the light bulbs, showing clearly that the light bulbs are in series. Draw the circuit on the board.

## Procedure
To start, perform the demo by step-by-step connecting more light bulbs to the power source, with the voltage remaining constant. The students record their observations. Then briefly summarize the observations on the board. Possible observations include:
• Only bulbs between the connections light up;
• The more bulbs are connected, the less brightly they glow;
• The last bulb you connect gradually glows brighter, while the other connected bulbs immediately glow at their final brightness.
• As you connect more bulbs, it takes increasingly longer for the last connected bulb to reach its final brightness.
Then, a discussion follows about an explanation. The third and fourth observations are the most interesting; you can use the explanation for the first two to retrieve prior knowledge. Explaining all these observations requires back-and-forth thinking, and it's important to ask probing questions and be very precise about the technical language. A tip for explaining the third observation is to ask about what happens to the resistance of a light bulb when the bulb lights up. If the fourth observation hasn't been made yet, it offers an opportunity for a prediction. Students can also predict what happens to the current during the slow brightening of the last connected bulb. It will decrease; visible with a current meter.


## Physics background
The explanation is best linked to the third and fourth observations in the situation of Figure 2 where the third light bulb has just been connected: the temperature of bulb 1 and 2 is higher than that of bulb 3 because bulbs 1 and 2 have just lit up and bulb 3 has not. Therefore, at the moment of connection, the resistance of bulbs 1 and 2 is higher than that of bulb 3, and thus bulbs 1 and 2 receive a larger share of the voltage in this series circuit. After connecting, the temperature of bulb 3 increases, so it receives more and more voltage (and bulbs 1 and 2 receive less, but the decrease in brightness is not visible to the naked eye). The fourth observation: as more bulbs are in series, the total resistance is greater, and thus the current is smaller, causing the temperature of the last bulb to increase more slowly. This leads to a slower increase in voltage across it and thus a slower increase in brightness. Finally, what happens to the current: the resistance of the last connected bulb increases, so the total resistance in the circuit increases and the current decreases.
