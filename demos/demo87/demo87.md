# Fluorescent Olive Oil

## Introduction

Extra virgin olive oil comes from the first pressing of olives and is more expensive than later pressings. This oil contains chlorophyll that fluoresces, aiding in determining whether olive oil is truly extra virgin. You can describe this phenomenon with a simple energy level diagram and explain the surprising observations.

## Equipment

- Bottle of extra virgin olive oil
- Two bottles of water
- Red laser pointer
- Green laser pointer
- White wall/paper
- Plant sprayer (water with some ink from a yellow marker pen)

## Preparation

A darkened room is not required but works better, and a digital camera is also helpful.

## Procedure

Your initial question is: Can you see light when looking at it from the side? Shine the red laser pointer on the wall. You'll only see a spot until you spray water mist into the light beam. You then see not the light itself but light entering your eye due to the scattering of water droplets. Directly shining laser light into your eye is harmful.

Then, place a bottle of water, a bottle of olive oil, and another bottle of water in the beam in succession. Shine the red laser pointer. You'll notice a red beam of light visible in the olive oil and that the laser spot on the wall is now less intense. Scattering of light by the olive oil explains why you see the beam from the side and why there is less light falling on the wall than before. Emphasize: like before, the light reaching the wall is not scattered in the olive oil.

Tell them that you're going to do the same with a green laser pointer. Let students predict what they will see. Have them write down, describe, and compare their observations. Now perform the experiment. You'll observe an orange beam of light in the bottle of olive oil and that the spot on the wall is still green. With water mist, you'll see a green beam before and after the bottle.

Students may write something like: "The light is green at first, turns orange in the olive oil, and then turns green again". This statement seems correct, but how does the color change of the light work then? How does a green beam of light become orange and then green again? Why do we see the light from the middle of the olive oil as orange and not turned back to green?

Discuss with the (qualitative) energy level diagram of chlorophyll (Figure 2): a photon with sufficient energy can be absorbed, and then another photon is emitted. This is called fluorescence. The emitted photon can have at most the energy of the absorbed photon. There is no source that can provide extra energy.

With a BINAS search task, students can then determine that the red photons cannot be replaced by orange photons in this way, but green photons can. Also, orange photons cannot be replaced by green ones in this manner.

Help students describe and draw the process themselves as much as possible, where a green beam of light was seen before and after the bottle and a green spot on the wall, but an orange beam of light inside.

Energy level diagram for fluorescence in olive oil
```


The energy of photons follows from Ef = hf. For the frequencies, it holds true: fred < forange < fgreen. During fluorescence, a (here green) photon is absorbed by the system, and part of the energy is released (how is unimportant) as the system returns to the ground state. See figure 2. The emitted photon, in the case of chlorophyll, orange, has at most the energy of the original photon. An orange photon cannot be replaced by a green photon later on, as the additional energy required is lacking. The red beam of light remained red for another reason. Apparently, a red photon has too little energy to be absorbed; it can at most be scattered without a change in energy.

Control Question: Some photons were created by scattering, others by fluorescence. What is the most important difference in energy of the photons between these processes?

Find out what the term 'fluorescence' has to do with the element fluor.

## Further Research

Additionally, you can measure the fluorescence spectrum.

## Safety

Avoid shining laser light into eyes, beware of reflections on the olive oil bottle. Only use Class 2 lasers of less than 1 mW, safe for eye reflex, with known specifications. (Green lasers sometimes also have a much more intense but invisible infrared beam.)
