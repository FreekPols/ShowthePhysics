# Contribute
An absolute advantages of Jupyter Online Books is the ability to have readers contribute. If you see a typo, if something is not clear, or anything needs to be adjusted, click the {fa}`github` button at the top of the screen and open an issue by clicking on the {fa}`lightbulb` button. (You need to have a github account though).
