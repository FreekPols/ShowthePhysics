    "# Show the Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "This book presents a selection of the 99 best, most beautiful physics demonstrations from the Dutch book series \"Show*de*Fysica\" {cite:p}`showdefysica1,showdefysica2,showdefysica3` as published by the <a href=\"http://nvon.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch Association for Science Education</a>. The three original volumes are cherished in the Netherlands by physics teachers and are used as a useful resource for many lectures. We hope that this translated and updated open access book will be just as valuable to a wider range of physics teachers. Where most physics demonstration books cover a large range of demonstrations, we included  strategies to make the most of these - making the demonstrations both magical and educational! Moreover, we included videos and opportunities to live code and use python simulations without the need for any software installation.\n",

    "\n",
    "This book originated in the collaboration between physics teachers and physics teacher educators, united in the <a href=\"https://nvon.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch Association for Science Education(NVON)</a>. The three Dutch volumes of Show*de*Fysica cover over a 200 demonstrations for secondary school physics, along with additional text on the pedagogy of physics demonstrations. Each demonstration has been tested by various secondary school physics teachers and their technicians. The process of developing, writing, and checking ensures that all demonstrations are effective and accessible.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Are our demonstrations original? Don't expect them to be so. Most demonstrations were inspired by earlier versions of the experiments - where possible referenced to earlier descriptions - and edited by the [authors](Authors). For several demonstration we included questions to check students' understanding of the phenomenon at hand! \n",

    "## How to use the book\n",
    "Demonstrations are fantastic. They offer so many wonderful possibilities to show the beauty of physics and amaze pupils, that we really should do at least one in every physics class. That may not always be feasible, but the objection \"which demo then?\" no longer applies. After all, this book provides 99 examples!\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely you can read this book from cover to cover, but that was not our intention. Our main idea was to help provide teachers with ample demonstrations that could be readily used in the classroom, thereby helping students to grasp physics. Therefore, we choose and developed the demonstrations that really add value to the physics lessons. Hence, rather than reading the whole book, you can use the search function of the book and look for the topic that you are teaching next week to find a demonstration that suits well.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "The different chapters on the pedagogy of physics demonstrations provide an excellent start as well!\n",

    "```{Warning}\n",
    "We have carefully conceived, developed, described and tested each of the experiments. Moreover, we specified safety issues where necessary. However, we are not responsible for whatever accidents, or injuries when doing a demonstration described in this book. We want to emphasize as well the requirement to test a demonstration before doing it with public. \n",

    "## Python\n",
    "In this online book you will find Python coding cells that you can run in your browser without the need for any additional materials. Our colleagues from <a href=\"http://teachbooks.tudelft.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">Teachbooks</a> contributed to this feature.\n",
