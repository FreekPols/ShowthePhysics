## Introduction
This demonstration shows how a fiber optic works. Additionally, it creates a beautiful light show. You might end up with a small water mess, but the demo is worth it.

The laser beam follows the water jet into the (white) sink. The inset in the top left shows a detail of the opening and the first total internal reflection.

## Equipment
- Transparent water tank (as large as possible) with a hole in it
- Laser
- Catch basin or sink

## Preparation
The setup must be well aligned. It is easiest to do this with a plug in the opening of the filled water tank. You can then aim the laser precisely at the plug. The demonstration works best in a darkened room, but it is not necessary.

The setup. We use a water cooler tank as a water reservoir. The hole in the tank has a diameter of about 8 mm; slightly smaller could also work. You can adjust the lab lifts' heights to set how far the water jet reaches into the sink.

## Procedure
The demo can be used for various purposes when covering total internal reflection and fiber optics. It can serve as an introduction and a hook for explanation, or you can use it at the end of the lesson(s) to test understanding of the phenomenon.

Due to visibility, it is necessary to gather the students around the setup. You can then darken the room and immediately show the demo. Afterwards, replace the plug and ask the students for an explanation. This provides a great opportunity to explain total internal reflection. As a comprehension test, you can ask what happens if less water flows out of the tank and the water falls more steeply. Most students will give the correct answer, and it is important to ask for an explanation. You might choose to have all students write down that explanation. You will get answers like "the light cannot follow the water," which provides a clean task for the teacher to dig deeper for a more scientific explanation. If you then remove the plug again and wait quietly until the initial speed of the water decreases (while enjoying the spectacle), most students will be amazed at how long the light remains trapped in the water. Only at the very last moment does the light beam no longer follow the water. In advanced classes, you can calculate the critical angle as a conclusion.

## Physics Background
At the beginning of the demo, the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle, causing total internal reflection. As the initial speed decreases, the angle of incidence at the first water-air transition eventually becomes smaller than the critical angle, causing refraction. In fact, this transition is somewhat gradual: if the angle of incidence is slightly less than the critical angle, only a small part will refract, while a large part of the light still reflects.

```{tip}
- A brief detour can be to close the top of the bottle (e.g., with your hand). Due to air pressure, the jet will quickly decrease, which surprises the students as well. Additionally, it offers an easy way to regulate the amount of water flowing from the tank.
- In advanced high school classes, a connection with horizontal projectile motion is also possible. With some simple distance measurements, you can determine the initial speed of the water.
```

## Follow-up
You could record the demo on video and determine the critical angle from the video (never done this myself).

```{warning}
Since you are working with a laser, it is important to ensure that the laser beam cannot enter anyone's eyes. Pay extra attention to reflective surfaces, such as a tap near the sink.
