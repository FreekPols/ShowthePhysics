# Powerful Balloon: A surprisingly revealing measurement

## Introduction
All students have blown up a balloon at some point. They usually don’t consider what happens inside the balloon. In this demonstration, the teacher shows that various processes occur in the balloon and that 'unexpected' results can be found through measurements.

The balloon on the electronic balance connected to the computer. This way, you can display a graph with the value indicated by the balance.

## Equipment
- Balloon
- Electronic balance with USB output (Adam balance or other digital balance)
- Computer with Coach 7 (or digital balance with a camera directed at it)
- Transparent stand to clamp the balloon in

## Preparation
Turn on the balance with the stand for the balloon on it. Set the balance to 0.00 g if necessary using the 'tare' button. Measure at two measurements per second. Inflate the balloon and place it directly in the stand on the balance.

## Procedure
1. Explain to the students how the demonstration works.
2. Predict what the balance will indicate and why.
3. Perform the measurement.
4. Show with the graph that the mass of the balloon increases significantly in the first two minutes.
    - *What could be an explanation?*
6. Provide the explanation of the demonstration.
7. Control questions: Why does an object become heavier when you lift it out of the water? Why does a hot air balloon have more buoyant force when the air inside it is warmer? What are the pressure and temperature in the balloon before the start of the experiment (just after inflating) and after reaching the equilibrium mass?

Change in mass due to cooling of the balloon.

## Physics Background
Two forces act on the balloon: an upward buoyant force and gravity downward. In an inflated balloon, the air temperature is about 37 °C. This is warmer air than outside the balloon. The air in the balloon will cool down by heat transfer to the surroundings. Lower temperature air corresponds to lower pressure. The volume of the balloon will decrease.

Since the buoyant force is proportional to the volume of the balloon, this force will decrease. Thus, the balance will indicate a higher mass. The mass change is on the order of a few tenths of a gram and can be accurately measured with an electronic balance. An indication of the volume difference can be calculated using the buoyant force formula:

$$ F_{buoyant} = \rho \cdot g \cdot V$$

With a mass difference of 0.20 g, we calculate that the balloon’s volume reduction is 150 mL. Our balloon, with a 'radius' of 10.0 cm, has a volume of approximately 4.2 L. The radius of the balloon with a volume of 4.05 L is 9.99 cm. This volume change is not noticeable with the naked eye.

The effect is most noticeable just after inflating. After a few minutes, the equilibrium mass is reached, and the pressure in the balloon equals the outside air pressure plus the balloon's pressure. The temperature of the air in the balloon then equals the ambient temperature.

```{tip}
- In addition to the graph, you can also display the mass value on a screen. Film or photograph with a FLIR-C5 camera to show that the balloon’s temperature is higher than the outside temperature. Heat (the air in) the balloon with a hairdryer if desired to make the effect stronger. Place the balloon on a tube or cup for better support against movement due to air currents and the like. 
- Tip from a tester: work in a draft-free room.

## Follow-up
An extensive analysis and more fun demonstrations with inflated balloons can be found in: Brouwer R. (2012).
