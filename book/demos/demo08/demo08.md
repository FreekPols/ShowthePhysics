## Introduction
In this demonstration metal balls change into ping-pong balls. Of course that is impossible, but the initial explanation of the presenter also does not make sense. So how does it work? A very simple demonstration that where the observations challenge the students to find explanations and engage them in reasoning with concepts as density, floating, and sinking.

## Equipment
* Three metal balls; 
* Three pingpong balls; 
* Corn used for making popcorn; 
* Small box or container.

## Preparation
Fill the container with the corn. Push the pingpong balls to the bottom of the container. They should not be visible. Keep the metal balls separate. 

## Procedure
Show the metal balls to the audience, pass them along. Meanwhile tell them that they look like normal metal balls, but that they are made of a special memory metal. Put the balls on top of the corn and tell the audience they should assume these balls have similar properties as corn. Let the audience tell you what happens to corn when you make popcorn. *Seduce* the audience to use the terms “greater” and “white”. 

Put the metal balls on top of the corn, then put the lid on the container and “heat” the corn by shaking the container. The metal balls will sink while the Ping-Pong balls will rise. Open the container: no more metal balls, but instead Ping-Pong balls ({numref}`Figure {number} <demo08_fig1>`)!

Of course nobody will believe that the metal really changed into plastic, but what happened then? Lively discussions will occur spontaneously. The surprise of this demonstration will captivate, but to figure out the secret one has to do some hard physics thinking.

The spontaneous reasonings are often going into the right direction, but probably need some corrections. Chances are that somebody will propose that the metal balls are heavier than the corn. Then let them compare the mass of the three balls with the whole container of corn. The metal balls are (of course) not heavier, but this is not a fair comparison. When you compare more or less equal volumes, then the metal ball indeed turns out heavier. That is a good opportunity to discuss density and the meaning of “fair comparison”.

If the metal balls “sink” because their density is greater than that of corn, can you then also explain that pingpong balls will rise when shaking the container? As a check you can put the Ping-Pong balls at the bottom of the container and leave out the metal balls. 

## Physics background
You will only understand the experiment when you become aware that there are two forces (neglecting friction!) acting on a metal ball and on a Ping-Pong ball. You have to compare these forces before you can predict what will happen. The corn exerts a buoyant force upward which for the metal ball is smaller than gravity but for the Ping-Pong ball greater than gravity. So the metal balls sink while the Ping-Pong balls will float on the corn.
