Ticker (height 2.4 cm, frequency 100 drops/s) and parabola of drops.
```

## Introduction
This demonstration beautifully shows the independence of the motion of an object in mutually perpendicular directions. Naturally, we are talking about horizontal projectile motion. This principle is made clear here in an almost entirely conceptual way, without quadratic equations but with stunning visuals.

```{warning}
**Safety**: Stroboscopic lighting can trigger seizures in people with epilepsy; this demonstration is not suitable for them.
```

## Equipment
* Dark room that can preferably be fully darkened
* Overflow vessel (see {numref}`Figure {number}<demo46_fig1>`)
* Two stands
* Height-adjustable table
* Clamps
* Ticker
* Bicycle valve tube (> 80 cm)
* Faucet with (about 1.5 m) flexible hose
* Sink
* Stroboscope
* Ruler

## Preparation
* Place a stand on the table next to the faucet by the sink.
* Attach a hose to the faucet.
* Attach the overflow vessel to the stand at a considerable height, letting the hose from the faucet hang into it.
* Push one end of the valve tube over the spout of the vessel.
* Attach the ticker with a clamp to the second, securely clamped stand, slightly lower than the vessel.
* Normally, your ticker ticks with a point on carbon paper to make dots. You can place the hose under that point, but it might puncture it. The point is on a vibrating plate: detach it and turn it over, so the point is facing up. Place the hose underneath, and screw it back in place.
* Position the ticker and hose so that a stream of water flows horizontally out of the hose and falls from a considerable height into the sink.
* Finally, set up the stroboscope to illuminate the falling water stream from the side.

The setup.
```

Next, there is some fine-tuning to do:
1. Turn the faucet on slightly, so that after a while, the outflow through the spout is exactly the same as the inflow from the faucet. The overflow vessel ensures a constant pressure on the outgoing water.
2. Adjust the height difference between the vessel and the ticker so that the stream falls into the sink in a nice arc. Ensure that the water still falls into the sink even at the maximum height of the vessel.
3. Turn on the ticker. Adjust the vibrating plate pressing on the valve tube so that it produces individual droplets. (You will only see the individual droplets under stroboscopic lighting but can hear it rattle, not hum, when properly adjusted.)
4. Darken the room, and illuminate the falling water with the stroboscope from the side. Adjust the frequency so that the droplets appear to hang motionless in the air, forming a parabola.
5. Adjust the flow rate by changing the height of the table.

## Procedure
Your demonstration might proceed as follows, starting from when the audience sees the droplet parabola.

*"How long does a droplet take to fall from the ticker to the edge of the sink?"*
  From the vibrating frequency, you get the time between two visible droplets (In the photos: 0.01s). Count the number of floating pearls in the arc ({numref}`Figure {number}<demo46_fig2>`) and you know the fall duration.

*"The pattern seems regular. What is regular about it?"*
  Not only the time but also the horizontal distance between successive droplets is equal ({numref}`Figure {number}<demo46_fig3`). You can measure this. From this, the horizontal speed of each droplet follows. It remains nearly constant during the fall.

Small initial speed.
```

*"How could you increase the horizontal speed?"*
  If you hang the overflow vessel higher, the outflow speed increases ({numref}`Figure {number}<demo46_fig4>`). The arc widens and initially descends less steeply.

```

*"If we hang the vessel higher, the outflow speed increases. So the arc widens. Does a droplet hang in the air longer now? How can you see that?"*
  The number of floating pearls in the arc does not change, so the fall duration remains the same as before. No matter how you change the height of the vessel, the falling duration is always the same for the same fall height. The fall of the droplet is a combination of horizontal and vertical motion, and these two motions proceed independently.

*"The vertical distance between the droplets increases. What does that say about the vertical speed of the droplets?"*
  The vertical distance between successive droplets grows: they accelerate in the vertical direction. Measurements of the vertical distances between the droplets roughly show: the same vertical distance is added between successive pairs of droplets.

*"What is the name of such a motion in which the vertical speed increases uniformly?"*
  Producing droplets at a frequency of 100 Hz means the vertical distance between successive droplets increases by 1 mm. Measuring with a ruler by eye will lack precision. Measure on a photo ({numref}`Figure {number} <demo46_fig4>`) and/or average the values.

From the measurements, an approximate value for *g* can be determined. With time intervals of $0.01$ s: if the distance increase is $0.001$ m, the increase in the average speed is $\frac{0.001}{0.01} = 0.1$ m/s, and the acceleration is $\frac{0.1}{0.01} = 10$ m/s$^2$. During the fall, the vertical speed increases uniformly.

```{tip}
Always fun to finish: increase the stroboscope frequency a bit, and the droplets will climb up the parabola, 'back into the faucet.'
Also nice: zoom in on the part where the stream breaks into individual droplets, the stroboscope beautifully shows this process.
If you can't use your own photos, you can use those from this article: the originals can be found on the website and enlarged. The scale of the photos is based on the height of the ticker: it is 2.4 cm in reality.
```

## Physics Background
Each droplet undergoes identical horizontal projectile motion. The droplets are launched at fixed time intervals. When illuminated at these same time intervals, each droplet precisely occupies the position of its predecessor at each subsequent flash. Thus, the parabola of droplets appears to hang still in the air.

If illuminated at slightly longer intervals (higher frequency), the droplets appear to move slightly beyond where their predecessor was, appearing to move slowly downward. If illuminated at slightly shorter intervals, they appear to move upward, back into the faucet.
In the beginning of the stream, you donâ€™t see individual droplets; they form later as the accelerating pieces of water are pulled apart. The ticker apparently creates almost evenly sized droplets with equal intervals. Cohesion does the rest.
