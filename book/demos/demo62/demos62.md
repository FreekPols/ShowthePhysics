## Introduction
Modern smartphones have a LiDAR sensor, which allows you to measure the distance to objects. The LiDAR sensor is designed to measure only in air. The speed of light in a transparent substance is different, and thus the measured distance is different. You can use this 'measurement error' to determine the speed of light in a transparent liquid.

## Materials Needed
- Smartphone with LiDAR sensor (iPhone 12 or higher) and a LiDAR app (phyphox) or a LiDAR pointer
- Tripod
- Pan
- Liquid (e.g., water)
- Tape measure

## Preparation
1. Place the phone in the tripod above the table. Ensure that the phone is perfectly horizontal. This can be checked with the app that indicates the tilt. 
2. Place a pan directly under the phone's LiDAR sensor (see `Figure {number}<fig:setup>`). Make sure the LiDAR sensor is aimed directly at the center of the pan. 
3. Verify the distance measurement from the phone to the bottom of the pan with a tape measure.

## Procedure
1. Provide some explanation about the operation of echo and sonar. Explain that this also works with invisible laser light, such as in police speed controls.
2. Explain the demonstration. Indicate that you will perform a distance measurement with a phone with and without water.
3. Draw a diagram on the board, such as the drawing in `Figure {number}<fig:schematic>`.
4. Explain how the LiDAR sensor provides a distance measurement.
5. Explain that you will pour water into the pan and then measure the distance again.
6. Let the students predict what effect the water in the pan will have on the measurement.
7. Carefully pour the water into the pan. Ensure that the water has come to rest. Use a water height of 5-8 cm.
8. Perform the measurement and note the measured distance on the phone with (S4) and without water (S1). Note the height of the phone to the water surface (S2). Measure the depth of the water (S3).
9. Calculate the speed of light in water using the given speed of light in air.
10. Optionally, repeat the demonstration with a different water height and perform the calculation again.
11. Control question: If we were to pour the same amount of another transparent liquid with a higher density into the pan instead of water, what would the LiDAR sensor indicate?
    1. A shorter distance than with water.
    2. A longer distance than with water.
    3. The same distance as with water.

## Physics Background
LiDAR is a technology that determines the distance to an object or surface with laser pulses. LiDAR works on the same principle as radar. The LiDAR sensor determines the distance to the object or surface by measuring the time elapsed between sending a pulse and receiving a reflection of that pulse. The laser pulses will travel more slowly in water:
$$ n_{l\rightarrow w} = \frac{c_{air}}{c_{water}} $$ 

This longer travel time results in an erroneous measured distance (S4) of the distance from the LiDAR sensor to the bottom of the pan. The speed of light in water is calculated using the time that laser light stays in the water. See Kuhn, J. & Vogt, P. (2022):
$$ t_{water} = t_{measured} - t_{air} $$
$$ t_{water} = \frac{S4}{c_{air}} - \frac{S2}{c_{air}} $$
$$ c_{water} = \frac{S3}{t_{water}} $$ 

Depending on the measurements, we find deviations from the literature value for c\_{water} between 0.5 â€“ 10%.

Figure 3. S1 is the actual distance between the phone and the bottom of the pan, S2 is the distance between the phone and the water surface. S3 is the water depth. S4 is the distance measured by the app.

```{tip}
- Depending on the power of the LiDAR sensor, the water depth cannot be too great. There will be a power loss; maintain a depth between 5-8 cm.
- Ensure the phone is securely fastened, as it may fall into the water.
