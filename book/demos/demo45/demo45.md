The basic setup.
```

## Introduction
Students often think that when you have related quantities and you increase one, the other will also increase. More of **A** results in more of **B**. In a series of experiments, {cite:t}`Tsakmaki2016` attempted to dispel this students' misconception. Using the context of the Magdeburg hemispheres, we explore Newton's third law in this experiment. You can direct this demonstrations towards various goals, depending on what you want to achieve.

## Equipment
* 4 stands
* 2 pulleys
* 2 stand clamps
* 2 strings
* 1 spring scale
* 8 mass blocks

## Preparation
Assemble the setup as shown in {numref}`Figure {number} <demo45_fig1>` beforehand.

## Procedure
Ask the students to predict the outcome of the historical experiment with the Magdeburg hemispheres. *Von Guericke put two large hemispheres together and vacuumed them. One side was tied with a rope to a tree, the other side was tied to four horses. The horses couldn't pull the hemispheres apart. Would it be possible if the tree was also replaced by four horses? Explain.*

Have a student read the value on the spring scale in {numref}`Figure {number}<demo45_fig1>`. Explain that you will replace the stand with mass blocks. *In the context of the Magdeburg hemispheres experiment, you replace the tree with four horses.* Ask the students to predict if the force read on the spring scale will increase, decrease, or stay the same, and whether they think the hemispheres will now separate.

Replace the stand with the equivalent mass blocks, as shown in {numref}`Figure {number}<demo45_fig2>`. Have the student read the value on the spring scale again.

## Physics Background
Newton's third law states that in equilibrium, there are always two forces that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. In situation 1 ({numref}`Figure {number}<demo45_fig1>`), the string attached to the stand prevents the block from falling. There is no acceleration, change of direction, or deformation, so the forces are equal. This means the tension in the string (and thus what you read on the spring scale) is equal to the gravitational force acting on the mass blocks.

The same reasoning applies to situation 2 ({numref}`Figure {number}<demo45_fig2>`): the mass at the left (which were already there) stay put. Thus the tension did not change.
