## Introduction

Boiling might seem ordinary at first glance, but there's a lot to observe and explain physically in this seemingly mundane situation.

## Equipment

- Thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask
- 500 mL beaker or water basin
- 1 m rubber tubing
- Sealing cork or rubber stopper with hole for tubing for the Erlenmeyer
- Glass U-tube that fits the tubing
- Burner
- Tripod
- Stand with male connectors and clamps
- Slightly colored water
- Matches or lighter
- Safety goggles

## Preparation

Prepare the setup:
1. Fill the 500 mL beaker with water and color it slightly.
2. Put a layer of 1 to 2 cm water in the Erlenmeyer and seal it with the stopper + tubing. Place it on the tripod and secure the whole to the stand.
3. Hang the tubing in the water of the beaker, ensuring the end is a few cm below the water surface.

## Procedure
Teacher: *We are going to heat the water in the Erlenmeyer flask until it boils. What will you see in the beaker or water container while the water is heated and not yet boiling and why?* Students write their individual predictions in the table (see below).
2. Teacher: *What will you see in the beaker when the water in the Erlenmeyer flask boils and why?*
3. Now turn on the burner, bubbles will soon appear in the beaker/water container.
4. Teacher: *What are those bubbles made of? What causes the bubbles?*
5. After the water in the Erlenmeyer flask boils, the bubbles decrease and the bubbles stop. 
6. Teacher: *How did that happen? What are they made of?*
7. Teacher: *We will remove the burner, what will happen in the Erlenmeyer flask? Why?*
7. Burner is removed. The water stops boiling, but then suddenly starts boiling again. At the same time, water is sucked back from the beaker and the Erlenmeyer flask quickly fills up.
8. Teacher: *Describe what you see and explain what happens.*

## Physics background

The experiment demonstrates several physical phenomena, such as expansion of air upon heating, condensation of water vapor, and the behavior of bubbles formed by boiling water. The process of heating causes air expansion seen as large bubbles, which are then replaced by water vapor that condenses in the cooler environment of the beaker. This leads to a fascinating observation of the water boiling again after the heat source is removed due to the rapid condensation of water vapor and resultant pressure change.

Further investigation ideas and safety precautions such as the use of safety goggles are also suggested due to the potential for the Erlenmeyer flask to burst when in contact with cold water after heating.
