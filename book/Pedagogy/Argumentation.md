## Development of inquiry skills through demonstrations
Conducting scientific research is a matter of making targeted and careful observations and applying your knowledge to understand them, and vice versa, of adjusting your knowledge and determining with which subsequent observations you can test and substantiate claims. Demonstrations are an excellent opportunity to practice this with students. Examples of the many important questions that need to be addressed during inquiry are:
* What can I conclude from these observations? 
* How confident am I about this, can the conclusion be strengthened? 
* If I change something, what will happen? 
* And if the outcome  changes or not, what will I learn from that?

This back-and-forth thinking between practice and theory characterizes research (Van den Berg, 2012). *In demonstrations, you can stimulate that thinking, guide it, and help improve it in a pleasant, motivating and safe way.* As always, the art here is in maintaining the balance between challenging students, providing them with the autonomy to think and do for themselves on the one hand, and supporting, scaffolding, encouraging and guiding their thought and actionon the other. Allow  students to choose and  do by themselves where they are already capable. But as a teacher provide examples and support  with what is still too difficult. Select the learning objectives for your demonstration from the range where students show cognitive readiness. Limit the numberof objectives, and peg them at a level that  they can achieve  with some effort. Provide  your students with a route using guiding questions and assignments, but also with hallenges and opportunities for their own input and personal contributions.

Learning physics requires doing physics. But is that possible  by participating in demonstrations? After all, demonstrations do not serve to actually solve scientific problems, nor do students  manipulate the materials by themselves... They should suggest to students  that with a little effort they too can eventually understand the surprising phenomena - a guarantee that is not provided in real physics research. As a teacher you  know the outcome and conclusion in advance, all you have to do  (difficult as that may be) is to produce the intended observations. It suffices to then present the accepted corresponding explanation, basically confirming what scientists already know. While this is a viable approach, it need not stop there. In your demonstration you may use the opportunity to  contribute to the development of inquiry skills which is not difficult at all.

To that end, make the research problems manageable before  confrontingyour students with them. Reenact the solving of those problems, as it were, during your demonstration, because there is a lot to learn from that. The easiest way to do this is to ask your students questions like:

* What do you think will happen?
* What do you know about the set up?
* What exactly did you see? What did you notice?
* How would you describe your observations as accurately as possible?
* Was what happened what you expected to happen?
* If we would repeat the demonstration, what would you pay special attention to?
* How can we improve our observations?
* Can you explain what happened and why it happened?
* Did we learn something from what was observed? How does that fit with what we already know? What remains unknown so far and how can we find out?

By finding the answers together, valuing them, testing them where possible, students practice the skills they need when they "learn physics" and "do physics" on their own later on. The demonstrations in Part XXXX of this book focus explicitly on these skills, but  in principle all the other demonstrations are suitable as well. Of course, you will have to adapt them to your own needs and include  your own ideas. Furthermore, you would not  ask all of the  questions suggested above in a single  demo as that would be far too strenuous for both students and teacher). Choose a clear, well-defined learning goal and give it  some extra attention using  a few appropriate questions. Examples follow below.

We  distinguish three levels of difficulty that  depend on what learning we aim for. In the simplest demonstration,  a surprising phenomenon is shown and your students practice scientifically "observing" and "interpreting". At the second level, observations are not merely interpreted explicitly, a conclusion is drawn as well and substantiated through  arguments basedon the observations. The third level demonstration involves skills that address the limits of the knowledge found. Guiding questions are, for example, *What assumptions have been made?’ Or: ‘In what situation is the conclusion no longer valid?” Part of exploring  these limits is also a consideration of knowledge-extension beyond those limits. Can the conclusion be generalized? Does the conclusion raise new questions, and how can they be answered?* 
In inquiry beyond these three levels  students need all their investigative skills combined.  As a teacher, you may realise that you no longer have all answers available.  . After all, at this most beautiful but most difficult level, students engage in real physics research.

## Argumentation
In scientific research, merely  finding an answer to the research question does not  suffice,  as only the most scientifically convincing answer is satisfactory.. In the classroom setting, then, you are faced with at least two different challenges. *First*, how do you get students to strive for finding the most convincing answer? And *second*, how do you teach what counts as convincing in the natural sciences, and more specifically in physics?<br>
'Argumentation' is  understood here to be the *production and critical evaluation* of an optimally convincing answer to a scientific research question. Many demonstrations focus on showing connections with practice and visualizing concepts. Many other  practicals  focus on *enabling students to do inquiry* and contribute to  developing investigative skills to produce convincing data.  However,  demonstrations can also be focused - if you frame them a little differently - on understanding *why* the data are convincing. To come to understand the nature of evidence and the need to convince yourself and others that the explanation you have found  for  your observations is the best explanation possible.

## Example: the most convincing conclusion
With Grade 10 students, the class jointly measured on one setup to determine the relationship
between the length and resistance of a constantan wire. \Students were asked to use the
values found (wire lengths *l* and the determined resistance) to write down a conclusion
about the relationship between length *l* and resistance *R* of the wire. Some typical
answers (after weeding out  unusable ones) are listed below, numbered 1 to 4. The teacher collected and ordered them  from *weak* to *stronger* before discussing them with the class. First the weakest:

1. As the length changes, so does the resistance.

Sstudents were asked if they thought this is a proper conclusion, why or why not, and if they could think of an even better conclusion. When thinking about the quality of the conclusion, a context may help. For example: suppose that the wire is part of the circuit in a device that explodes if too much current flows. The research task: determine the length of wire needed for a maximum but safe current of $X$ amperes. 

The  context serves tomake  the quality of the conclusion tangible and important, as it  helps to create a safe device that works well.

Next, previous student answers were presented one after the other, statements 2-4,  in order of increasing quality. Each time  students were asked to think of an even better conclusion than the one presented. .

2. As the length increases, so does the resistance.
3. If the length increases twice as much, the resistance also increases twice as    much.
4. The resistance is directly proportional to the length where $R = 14.5 *l$.
 It was noted that  you can't do much with answers 1-3, doing  research with results such as these is pointless.
 Note was also that answer 4 becomes even more convincing by presenting the corresponding
   evidence (e.g., a graph).

Students in Grade 10 can usually identify the fourth answer as the best. But what *makes* it the best? What are the characteristics of the best answer? What makes an answer  helpful in determining exactly how long the wire should be in the fictional device? Once  they have answers to those questions and know  that these  are what is worth remembering from this activity, its goal has been attained. With a little coaching,  students should be able to figure out that an answer is better if it:
* contains more information ('increase' is more informative than 'change')
* gives more detail ('twice as large' is more detailed than 'increase')
* contains numbers in addition to words (only when you know the ratio can you calculate the length).

A nice final conclusion to this activity could be: *the answer to the research question should be consistent with the measurements and be as informative, complete and useful as possible*. The concepts of 'informative, complete and useful' should have become more concrete and clear. They should provide  a practical stepping stone towards developing the overarching, but abstract concepts of *validity* and *reliability* (of measurement results, interpretations and conclusions).

### 'Rebuilding a demonstration'
Argumentation is  important not only in drawing conclusions; it plays a central role in *every* phase of an investigation. Below, some examples illustrate how the demonstrations on this site can  easily be supplemented  for "learning to do argumentation" in other phases of research. We do this first based on the demonstration 'Uphill ... downhill' from this collection and then with another demonstration after Pols et al. (2022). These practical examples can later be used at one's discretion to convert other demonstrations.

In the (v,t) diagram, the direction coefficient of upward motion is different from that of downward motion. 
```

Demonstration "Uphill up... downhill" focuses on the idea that the acceleration of an up-and-down movement  at the highest point is not necessarily 0. So the focus is on developing conceptual knowledge. How can we focus this same demonstration on argumentation?

If you look closely at the (v,t) diagram, you can see that the inclination  of the graph is not constant. When the trolley rolls upward, the acceleration seems to be greater than when it rolls downward. Is that a measurement error? Is the friction different? Is there some physical phenomenon that provides a possible explanation? After the students suggest some possibilities the question  becomes, what can we do to investigate this? For example, one could turn the cart around and see if the graph remains the same. Should we perhaps look at other quantities than the acceleration to get a better view of what exactly is happening? Suppose someone suggests  that the direction of the frictional force reverses at the top and could cause  a kink in the (v,t) graph. How could they  convince others of this? For example, what graph could they use to argue the point?

In a demonstration, identify  the different goals and then select  one goal to focus on. Keep it manageable for your students and yourself, focus on one or two aspects of argumentation, and expand to  other aspects  next time, gradually expanding the issue. You don't have to cover everything in a real investigation all at once.

### The swinging pirate
Students first watch an exciting clip from a pirate movie in which the hero swings from one ship to another on a long rope, while swords flash and explosions go off everywhere. The assignment: design a new stunt for such a movie, in which the hero lands on the second ship at exactly the right moment. To do this, do research using a model: a mass piece hanging from a string. The first step in the research is an orientation to the situation and determining the research question.

*Orientation: What needs to be researched?* 

Translating the pirate's movement to a mass piece on a string is not that difficult. Based on the context and knowledge about swings, we have seen that students can create initial research questions about the factor that can  influence the "swing time" and have testable expectations in that regard. (The informal term ‘swing time’ refers to the time it takes the pirate to reach the other side. The term ‘period’ is introduced only if students express a clear need for it, which they often do not at this stage.)


Using the research questions they come up with, the same approach as was used  with the conclusions about the constantan thread can be applied again. If necessary add your own ideas to the research questions they come up with, and present them in order of increasing quality.  Presenting them one by one, ask whether they think it’s a good research question, how it could be made even better, and what they think is improved each time.: <br>
These are some examples for a mass piece swinging back and forth on a string is the research question:
1. How fast does the mass piece swing?
2. Does the swing time change when the mass of the mass pice is changed?
3. Does the swing time increase as the mass of the mass piece increases?
4. Is the swing time proportional to the mass of the mass piece?
5. What formula or graph can you use to find the swing time if you know the
   mass of the mass pieve?

Questions for discussion: *Is this a good research question? Why or why not? Can you think of an even better one? Do the answers to questions 1-4 help  the stunt person in any way? What would help?* 

Together, detect  what are the characteristics of a good research question. Again, you can aim for a nice final conclusion: physicists in their research often try to establish a *relationship* (or lack thereof) between an independent and dependent variable. This is a fundamental insight. If you can't figure out what to measure, you usually can't even begin your research!

*Controlling variables and measuring them fairly* 

Once a good research question is available it is time to start thinking about how to make suitable measurements. For the pendulum test, students in grade 10 usually do figure out  that in addition to mass, the swing time may depend on the initial angle and length. 

Before you then start measuring, you can ask students: how are we going to do this? Make that question concrete, for example as follows: *I have prepared tables to fill in the readings. Which of these do you think is best, which is worst, and why?*

``` {figure} Figures/VariableTabels.png

Tables at 'controlling variables
```

Based on  the tables shown here, you can encourage students to think about the interval between measurements, the range in the independent variable(s), and the concept of fair measurement. This is meant to have them consider  in advance the consequences of the choices to be made during the collection of data, and their impact on the quality of the answer that is yet to be found. This can help them to plan  a step they very easily skip in independent work. After the discussion, the class can prepare itsr own tables for use in the demonstration, and think as a team about why these tables are satisfactory. 

Another option is to deliberately (allow them to) choose an unsuitable table(e.g., Table 1.4) in your demonstration, have the students experience its awkwardness  and  discuss that after doing a few  measurements. In this particular example this approach is less suitable if the influence of mass is investigated, since it has no systematic influence on the swing time, which would complicate the discussion. In the investigation of the influence of the length however the approach with an unsuitable table can be very instructive .

Next ask the class to draw a conclusion, and to check carefully whether that conclusion can be defended on the basis of the data. Make the meaning of  ‘checking carefully' clear and concrete, with questions such as:
* Could the change also have been caused by something else? 
* Do you now also know what happens if you make  the length ten times greater? 
* How sure are you of the shape of the graph between measurements?*

Most students will only put time and energy into finding and usingthe correct measuring methods when they see what all that effort is good for. You can tell them that, but we think it is more instructive if students think about it themselves and  try to give their own reasons in an activating approach. In practicals, that can quickly become  cumbersome, but in demonstrations this can be done quite smoothly and collaboratively. These ‘correct methods’ are of course not immediately ready and applicable, but fit into a learning pathway for 'learning to investigate'.

*Interpreting measurements* 

The absence of an influence of mass and (small) initial angle on the period is often not explored in  common practicals and demonstrations about the pendulum. A missed opportunity! Just when students expect a connection that is not there (according to theory)  interpreting the data becomes a real problem that requires a solution. After all, while there *will* be fluctuation in measurements due to measurement errors, do these imply that there is an influence or not? What could cause the fluctuations: the measurement method, outside influences, or a possible relationship between the quantities? Because students are often inclined to analyze and present their data in such a way that they confirm what they expected to find, making work of this can be useful. Feel free to let them help carrying out the measurements, throw in some friendly challenges: : *You’re getting different results every time, can’t you try to do better?* Or: * we have  repeated the measurement a few times, would it help to average the results?* And: *you measured really well, and you see something different from what you expected. Which is more convincing, what you see or what you expected?* In this ways, you work on developing argumentation skills by focusing on reasons for repeating measurements, minimizing measurement error, and reporting dispersion.

 For a definitive answer to the question whether mass (or initial angle) affects the pendulum , set up two  pendulums of equal length butdifferent mass (or  initial angle) and release them simultaneously.  C carefully prepared they will keep swinging nicely side by side. But if you want students to learn to investigate for themselves, avoid doing this right away. Although that quickly confirms of the targeted conceptual relations it would completely prevent students from starting to  think for themselves about inquiiry.. By the way, this is alsoan example of using the power of demonstrations in which nothing actually happens!
